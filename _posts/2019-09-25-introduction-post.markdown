Setting up this blog was easier than I thought, at least it became easier after Step 4. Everything before that was new to me.
It was the first time I've used the Command Prompt and learning how to navigate to the file I wanted took a little bit of time. 
Luckily I had this [Windows Tutorial](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr05/cos126/cmd-prompt.html) on how to use Command Prompt.

I struggled with turning the Gemfile into a file without the `.txt`, naming the markdown file, and of course using Command Prompt.

I'm still confused about several things: 
- What is the purpose of the `.gitignore` file?
- Do the items in the Horizontal Rule at the top of this file autogenerate?
	For example: where it says `date: ` do I have to retype the numbers myself 
	or does the program do that for me?
- How long does the local server stay open? Do I have to open one every time I want to use it?

I'm looking forward to using markdown with more blogs because it is surprisingly easy and simple to make webpages.
