So this post is very late, but I'm proud of myself for doing it now instead of not doing it at all.

I think step 1 of this lab was the most difficult part. Without the help of Dr. Goadrich I don't think I could've done it.
Using jekyll was new to me. I had trouble just figuring out how to change the picture. But now that I did I really like the look of it.
Also setting up the Long Haul template was difficult, but now that it works I really like the aesthetics. 

I'm still confused about how to edit the `header.html` file. I'm not quite sure how to delete the GitHub and Download links, but I'll figure it out. 
So turnes out I already did it and I just needed to push the changes to guthub.

I'm looking forward to finishing these labs and finishing the project with the rest of my team. I have a lot of work to do and I'm finally getting 
my stuff in order. I want to come back to Hendrix next year and see my friends again, in order to do that I have to finish this semester strong!

On a completely separate note, I've been listening to some [Skyrim music](https://youtu.be/hBkcwy-iWt8) while doing my homework. It helps from 
getting too bored.

Now all that's left is to add pictures.

Maybe using `../img/skyrim.jpg` will work?
