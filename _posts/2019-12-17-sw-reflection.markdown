I think the skills and talents that are most valuable in carrying out the social change work that I did with the Salvation Army were my skills with 
HTML and CSS. I designed and tweaked a lot of the pages that we used on our website. I think the one I'm most proud of is the landing page. I spent 
a lot of time on the landing page, carefully constructing the Bootstrap in a way that I thought looked neat and easy on the eyes. I think my skills 
in CSS and HTML helped me get a better understanding of the structure of Bootstrap and how to format my code in different ways to suit specific needs. 
I also learned how to use Bootstrap’s extensive CSS classes to stylistically format my webpage in ways I’ve never done before. 

The Salvation Army’s approach to making social changes is best seen in their desire for an easier way to keep track of volunteers. I believe that 
our efforts in making the website will allow them to easily coordinate their organization’s progress so that they can focus more on the community. 

A challenge that I came across that I did not think would be a problem was how difficult the front end work would be. A lot of my time was spent 
looking up why snippets of code didn’t do what I wanted it to do and figuring out why some things were formatted differently on one computer than 
they were on another. The skills I learned in class helped a lot when it came to prioritizing our to-do list. Learning to use Vertabelo helped us 
understand how to format the data tables and helped us keep track of how each table interacted with each other. Using Mockup gave us a model for what 
each page would look like; of course, the website looks drastically different now from what we originally imagined. 

Working with the Salvation Army has made me realize that people in my community need help. I feel more inclined to volunteer to help the poor and 
the needy. I see comercials for the Salvation Army back home in New Orleans all the time. Maybe if I can lend a helping hand I could make a difference 
in my home town. Even if I find that the Salvation Army doesn't suit me I can always volunteer with House for Humanity.
